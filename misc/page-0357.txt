          Looking for the Edge                                                        337

               My own interest in historical patterns owes a great deal to the work of
          Victor Niederhoffer. His Daily Speculations web site is a source of many
          testable ideas regarding market movements:
          www.dailyspeculations.com
               Henry Carstens’ online resource, An Introduction to Testing Trading
          Ideas, is a worthwhile and popular resource:
          www.verticalsolutions.com/books.html
               Mike Bryant’s trading systems work is quite good; here’s a collection
          of free downloads from his site:
          www.breakoutfutures.com/PreDownload.htm
               Rob Hanna’s blog tests a number of historical trading patterns and is a
          great stimulus for your own research:
          www.quantifiableedges.blogspot.com
               Two subscription services that do a fine job of testing trading ideas are
          the SentimenTrader site from Jason Goepfert (www.sentimentrader.com)
          and the Market Tells letter from Rennie Yang (www.markettells.com).
               Henry, Rob, Jason, and Rennie all contributed segments to Chapter 9
          of this book, offering insights into the relevance of testing ideas for self-
          coaching.
