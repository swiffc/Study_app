          with those negative thoughts, challenging them and coming up with dif-
          ferent ways of viewing the situation. This is truly self-coaching, because,
          just as the second column is the voice of the negative self-talk, the fourth
          column becomes the voice of the inner coach.

              The cognitive journal can become a forum in which we vigorously
              and emotionally challenge our most negative thought patterns.
