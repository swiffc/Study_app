              I like books that interview successful traders and portfolio man-
          agers; these books provide positive models for how to view markets and
          trading decisions. Among the most popular are the Market Wizards books
          by Jack Schwager; Inside the House of Money by Steven Drobny (Wiley,
          2006), and Hedge Hunters by Katherine Burton (Bloomberg, 2007). Other
          models can be found in the writings of the contributors to Chapter 9: http://

          trading-coach.html. See also the Daily Speculations site (www.daily
          speculations.com) for interesting ways to think about markets and trading.
