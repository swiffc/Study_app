          Stress and Distress                                                      65

              Make sure that you structure your learning process as a trader in a way
          that will build success and confidence. This process will help greatly with
          the management of stress and distress. That topic—and especially the topic
          of how to find your trading niche—is covered in depth in the Enhancing
          Trader Performance book, including a section on psychological trauma.
          A detailed discussion of how emotional states affect trading can be found
          in The Psychology of Trading. Links to both books can be found on the
          Trading Coach blog (www.becomeyourowntradingcoach.blogspot.com).
              If you’re looking for a book specific to stress and trading, you might
          look into Mastering Trading Stress by Ari Kiev, MD (www.arikiev.com),
          which is written by an experienced trading coach.
              How do emotions affect financial decisions? Two good books are
          Richard L. Peterson’s Inside the Investor’s Brain, published by Wiley
          (2007) and Your Money and Your Brain, written by Jason Zwieg (Simon &
          Schuster, 2007).
              Information on the research of James Pennebaker regarding writing
          as a way of coping with stress and distress can be found on his page:
