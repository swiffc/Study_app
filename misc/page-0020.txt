          resources for developing traders. Acknowledgments are also due to those
          whose work has inspired my own: philosophers Ayn Rand, Brand Blan-
          shard, Colin Wilson, and G. I. Gurdjieff; the many psychologists and re-
          searchers who have contributed to the brief therapy and positive psychol-
          ogy literatures; and the traders who were formative in my development:
          Victor Niederhoffer, Linda Raschke, Chuck McElveen, and the many hedge
          fund traders I’ve been privileged to work with in the past few years. My
          colleagues at Upstate Medical University have been inspirational and sup-
          portive throughout my second career; special thanks to Mantosh Dewan,
          MD; Roger Greenberg, PhD; and John Manring, MD.
              This is also my opportunity for a shout-out to those who write and
          play the music that kept me company through the writing of this book:
          Edenbridge, Armin van Buuren, Ferry Corsten, Cruxshadows, Assemblage
          23, VNV Nation, and many others that you may discover on the Become
          Your Own Trading Coach blog.
              Deepest thanks, as well, to the Wiley production staff and my fantastic
          and supportive editors, Pamela van Giessen, Kate Wood, and Emilie Her-
          man. They’ve been tremendously helpful in bringing this book to life. My
          appreciation also goes out to the many readers of the blog, particularly
          those who have actively participated with their comments and insights.
          I hope this book contributes to your continued happiness and trading
          success.
