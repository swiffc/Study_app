                                                             —Ayn Rand



             n this chapter, I sought the perspectives of experienced traders who

         I   share their views on the Web. The question I asked them was simple:


              “What are the three things you have found most helpful in mentor-
              ing/coaching yourself as a trader?”


               I think you’ll find their outlooks worthwhile, and I know you’ll benefit
          from checking into the resources these traders provide. To coach yourself,
          you don’t need to reinvent wheels. The guidance of those who have come
          before you can be invaluable. Think of this chapter as lessons in the best
          practices of self-coaching. Look for the themes emphasized by a majority
          of the contributors; these themes include the best of the best practices.
