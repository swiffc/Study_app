         Conclusion                                                               341


         pursue wholly new challenges. The enemy of greatness is not evil; it’s medi-
         ocrity. Don’t settle for the mediocre. You don’t have to be an artist and art
         teacher to make a work of art out of your life. And if trading is your path,
         learn from those who have blazed the trail ahead of you. Your final assign-
         ment is to absorb the resources from the various chapters of this book and
         select the few that will best support your self-coaching. They will provide
         the brushes and paint with which you’ll create your life’s artwork.
