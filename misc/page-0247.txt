                       Coaching Your
                      Trading Business


                    He is not great who is not greatly good.
                                                  —William Shakespeare




              n the previous chapters, we have explored ways of coaching yourself

         I    by becoming your own trading psychologist. Now we will turn to an-
              other facet of self-coaching: guiding your trading business. You, as a
          trader, are a business person no less than someone who offers goods and
          services to the public. You have overhead to cover, and you have returns
          you need to make to stay in business. Like any business owner, you risk
          your time, effort, and capital to earn returns higher than you could obtain
          from other activities. But are you getting the best return for your efforts?
          Are you taking the right amount of risk at the right times? Are you devot-
          ing the majority of your efforts to the activities that will provide the best
          returns? When you are your own business coach, you focus both on do-
          ing the right things and upon doing things right. There’s much you can do
          as your own psychologist. Now let’s see how you can thrive as your own
          business consultant . . .



          LESSON 71: THE IMPORTANCE
          OF STARTUP CAPITAL

          If you consistently break even in your trading, you will eventually lose
          all your capital. This is because there are costs embedded within trading,
          such as commissions and fees for data services, software, and computer

                                                                                    227
