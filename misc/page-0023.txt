                                      CHAPTER 1




                                     Change
                          The Process and the Practice




                    The mind has exactly the same power as the hands;
                    not merely to grasp the world, but to change it.
                                                          —Colin Wilson



                 ou are reading this book because you want to coach yourself to

         Y       greater success in the financial markets. But what is coaching?
               At the root of all coaching efforts is change. When you are your own
          trading coach, you are trying to effect changes in your thoughts, your feel-
          ings, and your behavior. Most of all, you are trying to change how you trade:
          how you identify and act upon patterns of risk and reward, supply and
          demand.
               There is a rich literature regarding change, grounded in extensive psy-
          chological research and practice. If you understand how change occurs,
          you are better positioned to act as your own change agent. In this chap-
          ter, we will explore the research and practice of change and how you
          can best make use of its sometimes-surprising conclusions. Coaching is
          about making change happen, not just letting it happen. It’s about mak-
          ing the commitment to being a change agent in your own life, your own
          trading.
               First, however, let’s learn about the process and practice of change.
