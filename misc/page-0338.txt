          Chart and a menu of different kinds of charts will appear. You’ll click on
          Line and select the chart option at the top left in the submenu. That is
          a simple line chart. Then click Next, and you will see a small picture of
          your chart, the range of your data, and whether the series are in rows or
          columns. Your selection should be columns, because that is how you have
          your variables separated. Click Next again and you will see Step 3 of 4 in
          the Chart Wizard, allowing you to type in a chart title and labels for the
          X and Y axes. Go ahead and type in Market Index and Mining Stock for the
          title, Date for the Category (X) axis label, and Price for the Value (Y) axis
          label. Then click Next.
               The Step 4 of 4 screen will ask you if you want the chart as an object
          in your spreadsheet, or if you want the chart to be on a separate sheet. Go
          ahead and select the option for “As new sheet.” Then click Finish.
               What you’ll see is that the Wizard has recognized the date information
          from column A and placed it on the X-axis. The Wizard has also given us a
          single Y-axis and scaled it according to the high and low values in the data.
          Unfortunately, this leaves us unable to see much of the ups and downs in
          the mining stock data, since the price of the stock is much smaller than the
          price of the index.
               To correct this problem, point your cursor at the line on the chart for
          your Market Index and right click. A menu will pop up, and you will select
          the option for Format Data Series. Click the tab for Axes and then click
          on the button for “Plot Series on Secondary Axis.” When you do that, the
          picture of the chart underneath the buttons will change, and you’ll notice
