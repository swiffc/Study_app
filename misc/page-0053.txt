                                 Stress and
                                  Distress
                           Creative Coping for Traders



                     If you plan on being anything less than you are ca-
                     pable of being, you will probably be unhappy all the
                     days of your life.

                    hen traders seek coaching, one of their most frequent requests is

         W          help with reducing stress. The assumption is that less stress is bet-
                    ter and, if they could eliminate stress, trading would go well. But
          is that true?
               In this chapter we’ll take a look at stress and distress, as well as the
          difference between the two. We’ll also explore coping and what makes for
          effective and ineffective responses to stressful situations.
               One of the great challenges of coaching in a high-intensity, competi-
          tive field is making sure that normal, expectable stress doesn’t turn into
          performance-robbing distress. In practice this means distinguishing be-
          tween the stresses that are part and parcel of the trading profession and
          those that we unwittingly place on ourselves.
               Let’s take a look at how you can make stress work for you in your
          self-coaching efforts.



          LESSON 11: UNDERSTANDING STRESS

          It’s common to hear suggestions that traders eliminate or greatly minimize
          psychological stress. This, of course, is impossible. The very act of trading
          requires daily encounters with risk and uncertainty. Psychological stress is

                                                                                      33
