          LESSON 77: CALIBRATE YOUR RISK
          AND REWARD

          I recently used Henry Carstens’ P/L Forecaster (www.verticalsolutions
          .com/tools.html) to simulate possible equity curves under scenarios for two
          small traders:

           1. Trader A has a small negative edge – The trader wins on 48 percent of
              trades and the ratio of the size of winners to losers is 0.90.
           2. Trader B has a small positive edge – The trader wins on 52 percent of
              trades and the ratio of the size of winners to losers is 1.10.

               I viewed the simulation as tracking returns over a 100-day period. The
          average size of winning days was $100 in both scenarios. That means that,
          if we assume that the traders began with a portfolio size of $20,000, that the
          daily variability of their returns was somewhere around 50 basis points (1/2
          percent, or $100/$20,000). If the traders averaged just one trade per day,
          then it’s plausible that they were risking roughly 2 S&P 500 emini points
          per trade and making about that much per trade.
               By running the scenarios 10 times each, I was able to generate an array
          of returns for the two traders:

                 Forecast Number                Trader A                Trader B

                  1                             −$904.2                 $769.9
                  2                              −727.4                  667.5
                  3                              −718.5                  614.7
                  4                              −763.5                  783.8
                  5                              −786.1                  528.7
                  6                              −551.0                  830.4
                  7                              −518.9                  933.0
                  8                              −610.5                  500.7
                  9                              −760.5                  791.5
                 10                              −812.6                  884.2


              What we see is that small edges over time add up. When the small
          edge is negative, as in the case of Trader A, the average portfolio loss over
          100 days is around 3 percent. When the edge is positive, we see that Trader
          B averages a 100-day gain of about 3 percent.
              Clearly, it doesn’t take much to turn a modest positive edge into a
          modest negative one: the distance between 52 percent and 48 percent
          winners and the difference between a win size that is 10 percent smaller
          versus larger than the average loss size are not so great. Just a relatively
          small change in how markets move, how we execute our trades, or how
          well we concentrate and follow our ideas can turn a modest winning edge
          into a consistent loser.
