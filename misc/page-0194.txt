          markets. Alternatively, the angry self-talk might lead to subsequent revenge
          trades that lose even more money. The third column chronicles all the con-
          sequences of the automatic thinking, both personal and monetary.
              Over time, a review of this third column will cement for you the abso-

          trading coach, it’s necessary to sustain your motivation for change. Seeing
          that your thinking is both tape recorder-like in its mechanicalness and sab-
          otaging in its consequences will sear into your mind that change is not op-
          tional. Reading entries from day after day after day that highlight the same
          thoughts, the same behaviors, and the same losses and lost opportunities

          is that they are not sufficiently specific in their entries and thus miss
          crucial details and understanding. Below is a sample of a journal that
          lacks detail and fails to help the trader understand the specific thought
          patterns and consequences that appear across various trading situations:

              Now let’s take a look at the same cognitive journal, but with detailed
          entries.
