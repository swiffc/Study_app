               Notice how the journal highlights the specific thoughts that led to the
          good trading decisions. By rehearsing this thinking, you can turn it into a
          positive set of habit patterns. Some of the best ways of thinking, I’ve found,
          have come from my interactions with successful traders. Talking with them
          has provided a model for how I can talk to myself during challenging trad-
          ing occasions. For instance, one trader set his entry price at a level that
          would ensure a favorable risk/reward for the trade and said, “The market
          has to come to me.” Instead of telling himself that he had to chase after
          opportunity, he insisted that he would only play when the market action
          fit his parameters. This kept him out of bad trades, but it also gave him an
          ongoing sense of control over his trading. It is difficult to feel stressed out
          by markets if you feel in control of your risk. I eventually adapted this way
          of thinking to my own entries, simply by never entering long trades on a
          high NYSE TICK reading and never selling the market on low readings. By
