                                     CHAPTER 6



                               Remapping
                                the Mind
                               Cognitive Approaches
                                 to Self-Coaching



                    The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting
                    our aim too high and falling short, but in setting our
                    aim too low, and achieving our mark.
                                                         —Michaelangelo



              n Chapter 5, we explored psychodynamic frameworks for self-

         I    coaching. These frameworks are especially relevant when we repeat
              unproductive patterns across a variety of situations over time. Funda-
          mentally, the psychodynamic view is a historical one: it emphasizes link-
          ages between how we coped in the past and how we now find ourselves
          responding to situations.
               The cognitive framework, like the behavioral one that we’ll visit in
          Chapter 7, is less historical: it emphasizes how we process the world in
          the here and now. Change the viewing and you change the doing is the es-
          sential message of cognitive approaches. While the past is not irrelevant to
          this task, cognitive self-coaching stresses what we can do in the here and
          now to alter how we process the world around us.
               Cognitive coaching is most relevant if you find yourself battling neg-
          ative thought patterns that interfere with your motivation, concentration,
          and decision-making. Some of the most common cognitive patterns that
          traders target for change include:
            r Perfectionism
            r Beating Up on Oneself After Losses
            r Worry
            r Taking Adverse Market Events Personally
            r Overconfidence
