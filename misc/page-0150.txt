          RESOURCES

          The Become Your Own Trading Coach blog is the primary supplemen-
          tal resource for this book. You can find links and additional posts on the
          topic of coaching processes at the home page on the blog for Chapter
          4: http://becomeyourowntradingcoach.blogspot.com/2008/08/daily-trading-

               Much of the framework discussed in this chapter comes from re-
          search into helping processes in brief therapy. Standard reference works
          in this area include the chapter on “Brief Therapy” written by Dewan,
          Steenbarger, and Greenberg for the volume Textbook of Psychiatry (Fifth
          Edition, Volume 1), edited by Robert E. Hales, Stuart C. Yudofsky, and
          Glen O. Gabbard (American Psychiatric Publishing, 2008) and the chap-
          ter on “Brief Psychotherapies” by the same authors for the reference work
          Psychiatry (Third Edition), edited by Allan Tasman, Jerald Kay, Jeffrey A.
          Lieberman, Michael B. First, and Mario Maj (Wiley, 2008).
               An excellent framework for thinking about making the most of
          strengths is the Gallup research described in Now, Discover Your
          Strengths, written by Marcus Buckingham and Donald O. Clifton (The Free
          Press, 2001). See also the popular management text Good to Great, written
          by Jim Collins (Harper Business, 2001).
               A full description of solution-focused work can be found in my chap-
          ter “Solution-Focused Brief Therapy: Doing What Works” in The Art and
          Science of Brief Psychotherapies, edited by Mantosh J. Dewan, Brett N.
          Steenbarger, and Roger P. Greenberg (American Psychiatric Publishing,
          2004).
